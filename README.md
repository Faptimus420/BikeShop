# BikeShop
Bicycle e-shop prototype made for Software Engineering course at KEA, 2019

First Python application, made in collaboration with several classmates. The requirement of the application was low-coupling, but the way the program was supposed to be split
into modules based on the requirements we were given was nonesnsical, resulting in an equally-nonsensical product.

Simple application acting as a bike e-shop and stock and invoice manager.
I MIGHT bet back to finishing the things listed as Current to do at the beginning of the logic.py module sometime, but the things listed in Next iteration are unlikely to ever be done, as a year later I'm still fed up with this mess of an application; the requirements we were given by the teachers were ridiculous.
